# Chromeboard
Chrome extension whiteboard app.

Resizable pop-up window that allows for drawing/erasing (basic microsoft paint functionality). Whiteboard state is stored in your chrome local cache so it will be remembered in different browser sessions / when popup is re-opened.

Purpose is to provide a way to draw out your solutions to problems easily & quickly within the browser (i.e drawing out tree/graph problems etc)

Currently you can clone the code to your machine and load it as an unpacked extension in chrome://extensions/. Soon I will deploy it to the store when I finish few more features up, and it will be available for download free there.
